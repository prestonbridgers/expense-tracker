# Frugi

Frugi is an expense tracking application built with a MERN stack.

# Details

The application is currently hosted on heroku and the live build is available to use at http://frugi.prestonbridgers.com/

The API is hosted locally on the server meaning it has no public endpoints.
All requests to the Node.js back-end are made by the React.js front-end.

# TODO

- Prettify the user interface (write better CSS).
- Add proper user authentication (likely with JWT and an encryption library for passwords)

## Stretch Goals

- Categorized expenses (luxuries, necesseties, etc.)
- Multiple views of expenses offering varying information about your expenses (supports sorting by expense categories)

# Contribution

Unfortunately, contributions are not being accepted at this time.
This project is more of a learning experience for myself as I dive into front-end web development.
Once I am satisfied with what the project has become I will open it to contributions.
